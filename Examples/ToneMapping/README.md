High Dynamic Range Tone Mapping

It's a technique used to convert HDR images (that can contain a wide range of luminance values)
into a format that can be displayed on standard displays with a more limited range.

There a 2 main types of tone mapping operators: local and global.
An operator is used to determine the new value for a given pixel, and they are usually classified
based on whether they apply adjusments to all the pixels or on a local context.
A global operator is used in this example.
