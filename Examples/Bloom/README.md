HDR Bloom

HDR Bloom is a post-processing effect that involves rendering a High Dynamic Range (HDR) scene.
In this example this effect is achieved by extracting bright areas from a HDR rendered image
using a tuneable treshold, then applying a gaussian blur effect to that result and finally combining
it with the original HDR image.
